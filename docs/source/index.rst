Welcome to NRSS's documentation!
=================================
The NIST RSoXS Simulation Suite (NRSS) is a collection of Python and C++/CUDA tools for creating, simulating, and analyzing Resonant Soft X-ray Scattering (RSoXS). It leverages the `CyRSoXS <https://github.com/usnistgov/cyrsoxs>`_ C++/CUDA library for GPU-accelerated simulations, and the `PyHyperScattering <https://github.com/usnistgov/PyHyperScattering>`_ library for reducing and analyzing the simulated scattering patterns. For more information on what RSoXS is and how you can possibly apply it in your own research, check out the NIST RSoXS project page at https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/resonant-soft-x-ray-scattering-rsoxs.
